## 🧠 What is Tarmac SDK (Go)?

A minimal Go library for building Tarmac guest functions.

A key feature of this SDK is its testability.
You can use the included mock clients or create your own.
You can also use the low-level hostmock to simulate hostcalls to Tarmac if you want to get really deep into testing.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Register your handler with the SDK:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/tarmac-project/sdk"
)

func main() {
  _, err := sdk.New(sdk.Config{
    Namespace: "tarmac", // optional; defaults to "tarmac"
    Handler: func(b []byte) ([]byte, error) {
      // Your function logic here
      return b, nil
    },
  })
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
}
```

## 🧱 Structure

The project is organized into focused modules so you can depend only on what you need.
